## With this little console app librarians can:
- Save data about books to an XML-file
- Load information about new books to an XML-file
- Get information on user requests:
  - Find books by genre
  - By author
  - By year published
  - By ISBN

[!NOTE]
This app has a CLI which doesn't implement all of the program functionality
You can see the rest of the functions in Library.cs, all of those are [tested](./Tests/LibraryTests.cs)
